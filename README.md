# `astro-protomaps-maplibre-screenshot`

This is a little project for me to take screenshots of map locations using Protomaps, MapLibre and the OpenStreetMap Nominatim search API.

I learned a lot from [Bishal Sapkota's project geojson-app](https://github.com/bishalspkt/geojson-app). Thank you Bishal!

I am writing up a blog post about this.
